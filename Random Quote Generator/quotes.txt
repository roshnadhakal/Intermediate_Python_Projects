I don't believe that if you do good, good things will happen.
Everything is completely accidental and random.
Sometimes bad things happen to very good people and sometimes good things happen to bad people.
But at least if you try to do good things, then you're spending your time doing something worthwhile.
Goals transform a random walk into a chase.
Competition is an easy way to get into flow.
A masterpiece is born a masterpiece.
Who will guard the guardians?
